# Simple Card List App

This is a simple card list app for learning React basics. First we create a `Card` component and once we have a single `Card` component rendering, we try to display a list of them with some fake data. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Quick Overview

```sh
npm i -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.
